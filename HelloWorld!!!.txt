Vector NOOB project:

1. Create vector for int type:
    a) create header for class vector only with the most important methods;
    b) implement vector functions.

2. Create vector template class for different types (rewrite your old vector):
    a) rewrite old vector;
    b) add new functions and iterators.

3. Download and install google test (gtest) with CMake from git repository:
    a) download and install gtest;
    b) write sample test to check gtest working.

4. Write tests for your vector.

5. Create sample program that will use your vector:
    a) build your vector as static library in visual studio;
    b) create program in visual studio which will use your vector header
       and cpp;
    c) make your program use static library of your vector instead of cpp;
    c) create simple cmake build for your program and static library.
